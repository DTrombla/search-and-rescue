# Search and Rescue

This app will allow the user to find a pet by searching variables such as animal breed, sex, size, and location to find their ideal pet in a nearby rescue shelter. The app utilizes the PetFinder API to take in the user's zipcode and requested pet parameteres and returns a number of photos of the animals available for adoption near them. The user may click on the photo and be redirected to the adoption site. The user can also look up information about a desired breed, provided by The Dog API and receive information about it, including height, weight, temperment, lifespan, and things they are bred for. Below is what the user will see upon visiting the site:
